scallop computes stable commutator length for elements
of B_1(F), where F is a free group.

-----
scylla version 0.9, January 8, 2012: 
-----
scylla computes scl in free products of cyclic groups, 
both infinite and finite.  Type ./scylla for usage.  
The option -l limits scylla so that it is non rigorous and 
can (sort-of) compete with scallop for small words in rank 2.

------
Installation
------
Just type "make".  You need glpk and gmp.  On a mac, if they 
are in their default fink locations, it should work.

------
Detailed discussion of the algorithm:
------
Exists in Alden Walker's thesis, which is not available yet.
