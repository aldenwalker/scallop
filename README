scallop computes stable commutator length for elements
of B_1(F), where F is a free group.

-----
Current version: 
-----
2.11 - December 10, 2010

-----
Theory:
-----
See Chapter 4 of:

Danny Calegari, scl, MSJ Memoirs 20. Mathematical Society of Japan, Tokyo, 2009


-----
Usage:
-----
	scallop [-r -e -v -h -mn -s filename] [i_1]w_1 [i_2]w_2 . . [i_n]w_n

where each i_j is an integer and w_j is a word in a free group, and where 
the formal sum of the w_i is in B_1(F).  The free group is defined implicitly 
to be the free group generated by all the letters appearing in any of the w_j.
For example, ./scallop abAB acAC computes scl(abAB+acAC) in the free 
group <a,b,c>.  Capital letters denote inverses.

Note that sum_j i_j*w_j is in B_1(F) iff each generator appears the same number
of times in the (weighted) sum as does its inverse.

The full list of options is:

-r causes scallop to use GMP and exlp internally for
exact rational output
-v verbose output
-e uses the rigorous (slower) version (see below)
-s filename draws an extremal surface, with each component being drawn 
   in a separate file.  Scallop also outputs a .fg (fatgraph) file, which 
   can be input to wallop (see Alden's website)
-h prints help
-mn uses polygons with up to n sides (this can potentially fix some of the rigor problems below)


------
Rigour:
------

The algorithm that scallop uses to compute scl is rigorous
for (finite linear combinations of) (cyclically) *alternating words*:
those where a generator never appears twice (or more) in a row. 
Hence: abAB is alternating, aaab is not, a is not.

For nonalternating input, scallop rigorously computes upper
bounds on scl. Moreover, the output is "statistically" correct
on *most* input, especially if the value of scl is small.

For a nonalternating chain, scallop will rigorously compute scl after 
applying the map x -> xxx for all generators x.  This is what the option -e
does internally.  This transformation obvously triples word length,
so it requires much more time and memory.


-----------
Compilation:
-----------

To compile, type

	make

in the directory containing the files.  This requires that
the glpk and gmp libraries are installed in the user's path.
This will typically be the case if glpk has been installed 
on the user's computer, possibly by using

	make prefix=PATH install

if the user's path is nonstandard.

Compiles successfully on:
OSX (intel) using glpk-4.28
Ubuntu 10.10, amd64 with glpk-4.43.


----------
Complexity:
----------
scallop comprises two rather distinct computationally intensive steps:
1) Building the linear program involves exhausting over all polygons 
   with number of sides less than 2*rank(F), where the possible sides are 
   basically all letters appearing in the chain.  Thus, a crude estimate
   for the number of polygons is (chain length)^(2*rank(F)).  These polygons
   must be stored in memory, so this complexity is for time and memory.
2) Doing the linear program.  The dimension of the space is the number of
   polygons, and the number of rows is approximately the square of the chain
   length.  This complexity is, of course, difficult to compute, but for
   reasonably sized problems (see below), is on the order of the creation step.

All tests run on Ubuntu 10.10 with a core i7 at 3.61 GHz.
