To install on Linux, you should be able to simply type:

make

Note that scallop requires the development libraries for GLPK and GMP.
On linux or OSX, these should be available through any package manager
(say, fink, on OSX).

To install on OSX with M1, type:

make TARGET=--target=x86_64-apple-macos14

Gurobi (http://www.gurobi.com/) is a state-of-the-art proprietary
linear/integer programming solver.  It is often far faster than GLPK or
EXLP, and they offer a free academic license.  Scallop supports using
Gurobi as a solver: to use Gurobi, edit the GURDIR path in the makefile
to point to your Gurobi directory.  You may also need to edit the
GURLIB line to make it the appropriate version.  Then to compile, run

make scallop_with_gurobi

To test, you can run ./scallop -mGUROBI abAB, which should give you 0.5.
